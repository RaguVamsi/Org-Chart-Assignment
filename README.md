# Organisation Chart

The "Employee Organization Chart" front-end assignment is a web page that provides users with an interactive interface to visualize and update an organization chart for employees. This assignment was completed using React.js for building the user interface, CSS for styling, and MirageJS to mock the API.
The first Page Greets the users and allows them to Get started and the second page is designed as the left side of the page features a list of employees, which is populated by pulling data from an API endpoint. Each employee entry in the list displays their name, designation, and team affiliation. To enhance usability, a search box is provided that allows users to quickly jump to an employee by typing any relevant properties. Additionally, a dropdown filter is available to allow users to filter the employee list by a specific team, narrowing down the displayed results.

On the right side of the screen, a tree-like chart is generated based on the entire list of employees. This chart visually represents the hierarchical structure of the organization, showcasing the relationships between employees and their respective teams.

Although the drag and drop functionality is not implemented in this assignment, the user interface provides a solid foundation for future enhancements. By leveraging React.js, it becomes easier to integrate drag and drop functionality, allowing users to rearrange employees within the organization chart interactively.

The project has been styled using CSS to ensure a visually appealing and intuitive user experience. Finally, the application has been deployed using Firebase, making it accessible to users through a live URL.
